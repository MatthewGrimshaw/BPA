# Creating Alerts for SQL BPA Environment

This guide defines all Azure Monitor alerts for the SQL Best Practice Assessment environment.
Alerts cover five categories: SQL performance (critical), SQL performance (warning),
BPA assessment health, agent & data pipeline health, and capacity.

All alerts are implemented as Azure Monitor Scheduled Query Rules against the Log Analytics
workspace and can be deployed using the `Create-SqlAlerts.ps1` script in the repository root.

## Category 1: SQL Performance – Critical (Severity 1)

### 1. Page Life Expectancy Critical
```kql
Perf
| where CounterName == "Page life expectancy"
| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(CounterValue) by Computer
| where AggregatedValue < 300
```
**Threshold:** < 300 seconds | **Window:** 5 minutes  
**Action:** Immediate investigation – SQL Server is actively evicting pages from the buffer pool. Check for memory-hungry queries and whether `max server memory` is configured.

### 2. Deadlocks Detected
```kql
Perf
| where CounterName == "Number of Deadlocks/sec"
| summarize AggregatedValue = sum(CounterValue) by Computer
| where AggregatedValue > 0
```
**Threshold:** > 0 | **Window:** 5 minutes  
**Action:** Capture deadlock graphs via Extended Events. Review application transaction ordering and lock hints.

### 3. CPU Critical
```kql
Perf
| where CounterName == "% Processor Time" and InstanceName == "_Total"
| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(CounterValue) by Computer
| where AggregatedValue > 95
```
**Threshold:** > 95% sustained | **Window:** 10 minutes  
**Action:** Identify top CPU queries via `sys.dm_exec_query_stats`. Check for runaway queries, parallelism issues (MAXDOP), or missing indexes.

### 4. Disk Latency Critical
```kql
Perf
| where CounterName in ("Avg. Disk sec/Read", "Avg. Disk sec/Write")
| extend LatencyMs = CounterValue * 1000
| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(LatencyMs) by Computer, CounterName
| where AggregatedValue > 25
```
**Threshold:** > 25ms | **Window:** 10 minutes  
**Action:** Check disk queue length, IOPS limits, and storage tier. Consider upgrading to Premium SSD or enabling read caching.

### 5. OS Memory Exhaustion
```kql
Perf
| where CounterName == "Available MBytes"
| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(CounterValue) by Computer
| where AggregatedValue < 512
```
**Threshold:** < 512 MB | **Window:** 10 minutes  
**Action:** Check if SQL Server `max server memory` is set correctly (leave at least 4 GB for OS). Review for memory leaks.

---

## Category 2: SQL Performance – Warning (Severity 2)

### 8. High CPU
```kql
Perf
| where CounterName == "% Processor Time" and InstanceName == "_Total"
| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(CounterValue) by Computer

### 9. Buffer Cache Hit Ratio Low
```kql

```
**Threshold:** < 95% | **Window:** 15 minutes

### 10. High Disk Latency
```kql
Perf

| extend LatencyMs = CounterValue * 1000
| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(LatencyMs) by Computer, CounterName
| where AggregatedValue > 15
```
**Threshold:** > 15ms | **Window:** 10 minutes

### 11. Excessive Recompilations
```kql
Perf

```
**Threshold:** > 50 per second | **Window:** 15 minutes

### 12. Blocking Detected
```kql
Perf
| where CounterName == "Processes blocked"
| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(CounterValue) by Computer
| where AggregatedValue > 3
```
**Threshold:** > 3 blocked processes | **Window:** 10 minutes

### 13. Lock Waits High
```kql

## Category 3: BPA Assessment Health (Severity 2–3)

### 17. BPA Stale Assessment
```kql
SqlAssessment_CL
| summarize LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated) by Computer = tostring(split(RawData, ",")[0])
| where LastSeen < ago(7d)
| project Computer, LastSeen, DaysStale = datetime_diff("day", now(), LastSeen)
```
**Threshold:** Any server with no BPA run in 7 days | **Window:** 1 day | **Eval:** 1 day  
**Action:** Check that the BPA assessment schedule is enabled, the DCR association exists, and AMA is healthy.

### 21. BPA Critical Findings Spike
```kql
SQLAssessmentRecommendation
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| where RecommendationResult == "Failed"
| summarize AggregatedValue = count() by Computer
| where AggregatedValue > 20
```
**Threshold:** > 20 failed recommendations per server in 24 hours | **Window:** 1 day | **Eval:** 1 day  
**Action:** Review the new BPA findings. A spike usually means a configuration change regressed SQL Server settings.

## Category 4: Agent & Data Pipeline Health (Severity 1–2)

### 6. AMA Heartbeat Missing
```kql
Heartbeat
| summarize LastBeat = max(TimeGenerated) by Computer

| project Computer, LastBeat, MinutesSilent = datetime_diff("minute", now(), LastBeat)
```
**Threshold:** No heartbeat in 10 minutes | **Window:** 10 minutes  
**Action:** Check if the VM is running. Verify AMA extension status. Restart the AMA service if needed.

| summarize LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated) by Computer
| where LastSeen < ago(30m)
| project Computer, LastSeen, MinutesSilent = datetime_diff("minute", now(), LastSeen)
```
**Threshold:** No SQL perf counters in 30 minutes | **Window:** 30 minutes | **Eval:** 15 minutes

| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(CounterValue) by Computer
| where AggregatedValue > 100
```
**Threshold:** > 100 per second | **Window:** 15 minutes  
**Action:** Review index fill factors. Rebuild fragmented indexes.

### 20. Memory Paging

| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(CounterValue) by Computer
| where AggregatedValue > 50
```
**Threshold:** > 50 per second | **Window:** 10 minutes

## Deploying All Alerts

Use the `Create-SqlAlerts.ps1` script in the repository root:

```powershell
# Deploy all alerts using defaults from terraform.tfvars
.\Create-SqlAlerts.ps1

# Or specify parameters explicitly
.\Create-SqlAlerts.ps1 `
    -ResourceGroupName "sql-bpa-lab-rg" `
    -WorkspaceName "sql-bpa-law" `
    -ActionGroupEmail "dba@company.com"

# Remove all alerts (to recreate or clean up)
.\Create-SqlAlerts.ps1 -RemoveExisting
```

The script creates action groups, deploys all 22 alert rules, and validates each one.
See `Create-SqlAlerts.ps1` for the full implementation.

---

## Testing Alerts

```powershell
# List all alert rules
az monitor scheduled-query list --resource-group sql-bpa-lab-rg --output table

# View alert rule details
az monitor scheduled-query show --name "SQL-BPA-01-PLE-Critical" --resource-group sql-bpa-lab-rg

# View fired alerts
az monitor alert list --resource-group sql-bpa-lab-rg --output table
```

## Azure Portal Steps

For those who prefer the portal:

1. Navigate to your Log Analytics workspace
2. Click **Alerts** in the left menu
3. Click **+ Create** → **Alert rule**
4. **Scope**: Select your Log Analytics workspace
5. **Condition**: Click **Add condition** → **Custom log search**
   - Paste one of the KQL queries above
   - Set threshold and evaluation frequency
6. **Actions**: Select or create an action group
7. **Details**: Name, severity, description
8. Click **Create alert rule**

## Implementation Order

Deploy alerts in this order for maximum safety:

1. **Agent Health alerts first** (#6, #7, #18) — if agents die, all other alerts go blind
2. **Critical SQL Performance** (#1–#5) — immediate service impact
3. **BPA Assessment Health** (#17, #21) — ensures the assessment system itself is working
4. **Warning SQL Performance** (#8–#16) — tune thresholds after 1–2 weeks of baselining
5. **Capacity & Informational** (#19, #20, #22) — cost protection and long-term trends

## Best Practices

1. **Start with agent health**: If AMA or Arc agent stops, all other alerts go blind
2. **Baseline before tuning**: Run for 1–2 weeks with warning alerts before adjusting thresholds
3. **Use action groups**: Separate critical (pager) and warning (email) action groups
4. **Set proper severity**: Reserve Sev 1 for issues needing immediate human response
5. **Include runbook links**: Add remediation steps in alert descriptions
6. **Review weekly**: Check for false positives and adjust thresholds
7. **Don't alert on everything**: The informational (Sev 3) alerts can feed dashboards instead of paging

## Cost Estimate

| Item | Count | Approx. Monthly Cost |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| Scheduled Query Rules (5m eval) | 18 | ~$1.80 |
| Scheduled Query Rules (1d eval) | 2 | ~$0.01 |
| Scheduled Query Rules (15m eval) | 2 | ~$0.07 |
| Action Group (email) | 1 | Free |
| **Total** | **22 rules** | **~$2/month** |

## Viewing Active Alerts

```kql
// Alert history in Log Analytics
AlertEvidence
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize count() by AlertName, AlertSeverity
| order by count_ desc
```

```kql
// Alert health overview - which alerts fired most
AlertInfo
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| summarize FireCount = count() by AlertName, Severity
| order by FireCount desc
```

## Integration with Azure Workbooks

The Azure Workbook dashboards in `AzureBPAWorkbook/` can display alert data alongside performance metrics.
See `PERFORMANCE-COUNTERS.md` for KQL query examples used in dashboards.
